First week of machine learning course dealing with linear regression. This is my first attempt at implementing the algorithm based on the week one information.

There are a lot of classes here, but the actual work is done by the GradientDescend class https://github.com/Tigerino/coursera/blob/master/machine-learning/LinearRegression/src/ml/alg/GradientDescend.java
